__Day 20: Again today, return to your first week of writing, to your Goethe’s Walking Stick... (See description.)__

_Again today, return to your first week of writing, to your Goethe’s Walking Stick, and to the ideas you’ve developed so far in the Topoi. Page through the ideas there: who you are, what you want our of your writing, whom you hope to speak to, the ideas you’ve written down in your Goethe’s Walking Stick, the questions you’ve asked. Find more concepts and ideas you’re interested in writing about. Then… - Work those ideas through your own Topoi, asking questions today about Form & Structure. - Write down as many questions as you can think of that belong to Form & Structure. - Choose one question to address today, one you think is truly, terribly, wonderfully interesting, interesting enough to captivate an audience you hope to speak to. - Finally, address that question._
