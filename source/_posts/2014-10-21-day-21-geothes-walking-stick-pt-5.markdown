__Day 21: Again today, for the final Topoi day, return to your past writing and Goethe’s Walking Stick...(See description)__

_Again today, for the final Topoi day, return to your past writing and Goethe’s Walking Stick and ideas you’ve developed so far in the Topoi: who you are, what you want our of your writing, whom you hope to speak to, the ideas you’ve written down in your Goethe’s Walking Stick, and the questions you’ve asked. Find more concepts and ideas you’re interested in writing about. Then… - Work those ideas through your own Topoi, asking questions today about Values. - Write down as many questions as you can think of that belong to Values. - Choose one question to address today, one you think is truly, terribly, wonderfully interesting, interesting enough to captivate an audience you hope to speak to. - Finally, address that question._
